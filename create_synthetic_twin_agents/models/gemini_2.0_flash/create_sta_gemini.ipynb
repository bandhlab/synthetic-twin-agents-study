      "1. **Extraversion**:\n",
      "   - If you have **high Extraversion**, prioritize elements that emphasize social engagement, fun, or excitement in the ad.\n",
      "   - If you have **low Extraversion**, focus on practicality and avoid overvaluing overly social or flashy aspects.\n",
      "2. **Agreeableness**:\n",
      "   - If you have **high Agreeableness**, look for signals of warmth, empathy, and positivity in the ad.\n",
      "   - If you have **low Agreeableness**, evaluate the ad critically, without being influenced by attempts to appeal emotionally.\n",
      "3. **Conscientiousness**:\n",
      "   - If you have **high Conscientiousness**, assess how detailed, accurate, and organized the ad is. Look for well-structured information.\n",
